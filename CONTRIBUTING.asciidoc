All quality contributions are welcome, including small typo fixes.
Note that we will review changesets, and may require amendments if we
detect any problems.

A list of current open tasks can be found in the
https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod/blob/master/README.asciidoc[README]

Pull requests through GitHub are accepted. You can also send “diff -u”
patches to https://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/[Shlomi Fish].

If possible, please create a dedicated branch for any changes. This
isn't a deal breaker though, as it is an easy fix with git. Moreover, every
atomic change should preferably be in its own git commit.

Moreover, note that new fortunes should preferably include source URLs or references for citation. This is given https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester[Wikepedia’s citation policy] and https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Gates&oldid=3534967#Misattributed[Bill Gates’ complaint about misattributed].

Happy hacking!
